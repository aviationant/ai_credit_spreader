PICKUP

Complete the algorithm for searching optimized trades. You've applied sorting:

ticker.df_contracts = ticker.df_contracts.sort_values(by=["call_put", "expiry_date", "strike"]).reset_index(drop=True)

Now determine traversal. Perhaps two tables for the temporary purpose of analysing short and long trades.

For index ETF's, here is the get_contract_list URL

https://api.nasdaq.com/api/quote/SPY/option-chain?assetclass=etf&limit=1000&fromdate=2025-12-11&todate=2026-01-30&excode=oprac&callput=callput&money=at&type=all

Note SPY and assetclass=etf

Once you can trust the trade finder algo, then it should screen correctly.
Then work on a seperate prediction module.
Consider building a seperate python program and passing data to it instead of trying to wrap
all into this one with CUDA and all that.

#Branch test


Trades populating much better. Need to tweak algorithm based on desired rankings.

Add logic for .env TICKERS and INDEXES to be able to screen SPY etc.

./utils/chronos_test.py utilizing both GPUs correctly and loading CSV historical
Adjust num samples and amount of historical data to get 70%+ direction prediction
Study chronos_test.py to understand ML modules
./utils/backtester.py is what you're using to run tests, not chronos_test directly

Pull data.

TA Module:
    Generate SMA windows - fast/slow
    Get X day streak
    Build to allow future predictor

Build df_companies for company with X day outlook and SMA outlook

Pull greeks for just directional (to same download time and reduce requests)

Build trades per ENV variables in df_trades
